**EzStorm**
---
`EzStorm` is a set of cheat menu functionality for the Mad Max game.
- support for Steam and GOG versions
- `AirBrake` - static flight of the player (also works if you are sitting in the car). It turns on and off on `RSHIFT`. The flight speed is controlled by the mouse wheel.
- It is planned to expand the functionality. XD. I wrote this plugin in 4.5 hours.

*Installation*:
- You need to install the `Ultimate ASI Loader`
- put `mm_ezstorm.asi` in the `scripts` folder
